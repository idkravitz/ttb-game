Installation
------------
The main requirements for successfull installation are: _>=python 3.1.2_ and _>=sqlalchemy 0.6_

Python can be installed by simply downloading installer for your OS here <a href="http://www.python.org/download/">http://www.python.org/download/</a>
or, if you are on a linux-based OS -- by package manager. For instance Ubuntu users can do it by:
    $ sudo aptitude install python3

For a quick installation of sqlalchemy it's better to have pip or easy\_install utilities, if you have so, just use one 
of the following:
    $ sudo easy_install SQLAlchemy
    $ sudo pip install SQLAlchemy

Or if you can't or don't want to have none of this nice tools you can download SQLAlchemy directly from here <a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/download.html">http://www.sqlalchemy.org/download.html</a>
and execute:
    $ sudo python setup.py install
